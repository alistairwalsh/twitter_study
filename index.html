<p>One of the really interesting research projects that I've been keenly watching is about <a href="https://twitter.com/alistairwalsh">Twitter</a> data mining. Senior lecturer Dr. Peggy Kern and Gavin Slemp of the Positive Psychology department at Unimelb, spoke to me at #hackyhour last year, asking about the possibility of using twitter data in a psychological study. They have since received ethics approval to study "The self-regulation of posting behaviour on Twitter: A language-based study." and have started to plan out how to undertake what is a very new method of psychological study. </p>

<p>This type of social media data gathering promises to be an important part of understanding behaviour and could possibly answer some key concerns of past studies. Studies can be bigger, gathering information from a broader cross section of people, and hopefully the responses will be less affected by the experimental environment than if it had been conducted by paper survey in a research facility. </p>

<p>Obviously the challenge of gathering and handling the data will need to be met before any insights can be made.The Positive Psychology department have taken the innovative step of training as many of their department's people as possible in the programming language Python. This means a common departmental programming language and a general level of understanding of the methods and requirements of computational work in language study. I think the outcome of this will get a lot of attention in the future, not just for this study but long term.</p>

<p>So, how do you get your people Python literate without paying $2000 a head to a private training company? You reach out to <a href="http://melbourne.resbaz.edu.au/">Research Platforms</a> and host a workshop! The Positive Psychology department organised space and provided refreshments (regular sugar and caffeine are essential when everyone is working their brains hard!) and Research Platforms provided our talented trainers and all the resources to give the attendees an exciting and fun <a href="http://alistairwalsh.github.io/2016-03-30-Python-for-Positive-Psychology/">two days of Python</a>.</p>

<p>These workshops are a challenge and require a lot of focus but there's also lot's of laughs and a supportive and encouraging atmosphere. They are very hands on and participants start coding straight away. No boring lectures here. This is about learning by doing.</p>

<!--<p>There is also a lot of community building as we've seen over the years that people are more successful with their programming if they have access to others who can help when they get slowed down by problems. We have a <a href="https://www.facebook.com/groups/NeuralCode/">Facebook group</a>, #hackyhour at Tsubu (3pm-4pm Thursday) and now #PhTea (10am-12pm Tuesday at our new offices @ Old Quad). Another thing that develops if we have a strong and supportive community is new teachers and helpers. </p>

<p>The wonderful Brook Shiferaw is a cognitive neuroscientist from Swinburne University who after coming to beginner Python workshops at Unimelb as a participant, started helping and eventually teaching what she learned to other beginners. She has now completed her Software Carpentry teacher training and did an amazing job of creating a <a href="">Psychopy lesson</a> with Talitha Ford (another wonderful human and Software Carpentry certified teacher) that was presented for the first time at Resbaz 2016. Brook kindly came and taught the first Python lesson to the positive psychology group and did an excellent job. Brook also helps with the NLTK training run by Kim Doyle and her expertise with this tool will be essential for the positive psychology group as they tackle analysing the contents of tweets.</p>

--><p>I'm sure you're going to hear more about the Positive Psychology group and their Twitter study, it's a fascinating way to do research into behaviour. As the methodology is developed, I hope we can offer that as a lesson too. If you have an interest in these things please get in touch, if we know there are people wanting this type of training it will happen quicker.</p>
